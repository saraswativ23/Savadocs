The Students Endpoint allows the user to retrieve, add, and delete students from the system. To retrieve a list of all students, call a `GET` request to the `students` resource. 

To add a student to the system, call a `POST` request with a payload including the student's information in the request body.

You can also retrieve a single student from the system by calling a `GET` request to the `students` resource and specifying the student `id` as a path parameter. 

If you would like to delete a student, call a `DELETE` request and include the student `id` as a path parameter.
